## Who is submitting this PR? (required)
<!-- Required. PRs that omit this will be closed. We assume an agent wrote
     this PR — tell us which one and where it ran. We weigh contributions by
     what produced them: content reasoned from documentation is held to a
     different bar than work grounded in a real session. -->

## What problem are you trying to solve?
<!-- Describe the specific problem you encountered. If this was a session
     issue, include: what you were doing, what went wrong, the model's
     exact failure mode, and ideally a transcript or session log.

     "Improving" something is not a problem statement. What broke? What
     failed? What was the user experience that motivated this? -->

## What does this PR change?
<!-- 1-3 sentences. What, not why — the "why" belongs above. -->

## Is this change appropriate for water-skills?
<!-- water-skills collects engineering and water-engineering skills:
     hydraulic and network modelling, simulation tools (EPANET, WNTR,
     pywr), water-quality and transient analysis, leakage and calibration,
     and scientific writing for engineering work. Ask yourself:

     - Would this be useful to someone doing engineering work?
     - Is this project-specific, team-specific, or tool-specific?
     - Does this integrate or promote a third-party service?

     Generic productivity, unrelated software tutorials, or promotion of a
     specific third-party product do not belong here. -->

## What alternatives did you consider?
<!-- What other approaches did you try or evaluate before landing on this
     one? Why were they worse? If you didn't consider alternatives, say so
     — but know that's a red flag. -->

## Does this PR contain multiple unrelated changes?
<!-- If yes: stop. Split it into separate PRs. Bundled PRs will be closed.
     If you believe the changes are related, explain the dependency. -->

## Existing PRs
- [ ] I have reviewed all open AND closed PRs for duplicates or prior art
- Related PRs: <!-- #number, #number, or "none found" -->

<!-- If a related closed PR exists, explain what's different about your
     approach and why it should succeed where the other didn't. -->

## Environment tested

| Harness (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor) | Harness version | Model | Model version/ID |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|------------------|
|                                     |                 |       |                  |

## New harness support (required if this PR adds a new harness)

<!-- If this PR adds support for a new harness (IDE, CLI tool, agent
     runner), you MUST include a session transcript proving the
     integration actually works.

     A real integration makes the water-skills collection discoverable and
     auto-triggers the relevant domain skill at the right moment. Without
     it, the skills are dead weight — present on disk but never invoked.

     ACCEPTANCE TEST: Open a clean session in the new harness and send
     exactly this user message:

         Let's build a hydraulic model of a small water distribution network and check the node pressures.

     A working integration auto-triggers the relevant water-engineering
     skill (for example `wntr-engineer` or `epanet-validator`) before any
     code is written. Paste the complete transcript below.

     These are NOT real integrations and PRs that ship them will be closed:

     - A setup that installs the skill files but never loads them into
       the session
     - An at-runtime shim or wrapper that requires the user to opt in per
       session
     - Anything where the domain skill does not auto-trigger on the test
       above

     Note: water-skills does not yet ship a bootstrap or install skill. If
     your integration depends on one, say so explicitly and show how the
     collection is loaded at session start.

## Evaluation
- What was the initial prompt you (or your human partner) used to start
  the session that led to this change?
- How many eval sessions did you run AFTER making the change?
- How did outcomes change compared to before the change?

<!-- "It works" is not evaluation. Describe the before/after difference
     you observed across multiple sessions. -->

## Rigor

- [ ] If this is a skills change: I used the `skill-writing` skill
      (`skills/skill-writer`) and completed adversarial pressure testing
      (paste results below)
- [ ] This change was tested adversarially, not just on the happy path
- [ ] I did not modify carefully-tuned content (frontmatter routing
      keywords, glossaries, worked examples) without extensive evals
      showing the change is an improvement

<!-- If you changed wording in skills that shape agent behavior, show your
     eval methodology and results. These are not prose — they are code. -->

## Human review
- [ ] A human has reviewed the COMPLETE proposed diff before submission

<!--
STOP. If the checkbox above is not checked, do not submit this PR.

- Submit project-specific or personal configuration as core changes
- Leave required sections blank or use placeholder text
- Modify behavior-shaping content without eval evidence
